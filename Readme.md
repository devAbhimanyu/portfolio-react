# It's me in a web-app format

The application is meant to act as my portfolio and will contain:

- 1 My CV
- 2 My Reading List, current and already read books and there links
- 3 My Medium article
- 4 Link to some of my github repos

The solution is built using

- Vite as the build tool
- React 17 with TS
- Scss and Bulma for styling
- git cz for commits
- Might add unit tests using React-Testing-Library
